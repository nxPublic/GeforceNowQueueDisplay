Since the default application for some reason does not show you your current queue position i made this little tool to have open while doing other stuff.
If you have suggestions open them as Issues and i will add them.

No clue why there are detections, its not obfuscated/packed or crypted. If you dont trust it, compile it yourself or check my uploaded file with a .mono/.net editor. 
(DotPeek is a great way)
